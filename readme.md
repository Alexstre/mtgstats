## MTGStats

This was an exercice in learning Laravel 4. The main goal of the site is to provide statistics about different deck archetypes in the current Magic: the Gathering standard meta game. It can also be used as a database of popular decks and displays the win rates of different archetypes vs everything else in the meta.
